(cities, towns, and villages) shown on the Land Use Map of China and other
published sources; includes most of the 12,000+ places included in the

coverages, with one coverage for each of China's provinces, autonomous
regions, and independent municipalities. Coverages are named CP<I>xx</I>,
where <I>xx</I> is the two-digit identifer for each province.</TD>

in all provinces of China. Some places listed in the China-T Dataset, but

<TD VALIGN=TOP><I>See .log files and the CP-.AML series for details.</I>

<P>ACASIAN digitized points from paper map sources and compiled data on
each point, including its name (in <I>hanzi</I> [Chinese characters] and
pinyin [transliterated into Latin characters]), administrative identification
number (CITY_TOWN_CODE), official population, and position in the administrative
hierarchy. This product is distributed for a fee exclusively by ACASIAN.

<P>UCD received this series from ACASIAN in March 1997 and processed this
data for use with the China-T Dataset (tabular data on central places compiled
from China's 1990 Census and other published sources).&nbsp;

<P>Supplemental data attributes compiled by ACASIAN were moved from the
.PAT file to a separate .CTC file keyed to the points' unique identifier,
the CITY_TOWN_CODE. These attributes were not verified or edited by UCD.
The CITY_TOWN_CODE was also retained in the .PAT as a unique identifier
for use in retrieving data in the .CTC file or other data at ACASIAN.

<P>UCD changed the pinyin names listed in the .PAT where the China-T Dataset
used different names for the same cities; we also added <I>hanzi</I> names
for certain higher-order cities whose <I>hanzi</I> names had been omitted
from ACASIAN's product. We also removed the <I>shi</I>, <I>xian</I>, and
<I>zhen</I> suffixes from both <I>hanzi</I> and pinyin names except when
the remaining portion of the names would have only one syllable.

<P>Next, UCD matched each point to a corresponding record in the China-T
Dataset, using as guides the CITY_TOWN_CODE, the pinyin name, the name
and ID number of the county in which the point is located, and the approximate
population of the point as shown in both the .CTC file and the China-T
Dataset. Each point was assigned a T1 identification number corresponding
to a record in the China-T Dataset. In a majority of cases, the T1 identifier
was the same as the CITY_TOWN_CODE. However, further processing was required
to resolve over one thousand discrepancies.

<P>This series included points some minor places which are not listed in
the China-T Dataset. Likewise, some central places listed in the China-T
Dataset were not included in this series; these included all urban <I>qu</I>
centers. A supplemental coverage (CPQU, <I>q.v.</I>) was created to contain
many of these points. All additions, corrections, and unresolved discrepancies
noted at UCD are being provided to ACASIAN to assist in the further development
of their commercial products.</TD>
