The CHGIS project began with a bequest from the estate of <b>Prof. Robert Hartwell</b> who passed away in 1996.  
<p>
Hartwell bequeathed datasets that he and Marianne Colson Hartwell created under the auspices of his **Chinese Historical Software, Ltd**. to Harvard Yenching Institute. These materials included a functioning set of GIS datasets for the Chinese Dynasties, from Tang to Ming, which were based on the concept of "co-location," or the use of GIS representations of modern county-level administrative units as building blocks to depict the approximate shapes of historical areas.
