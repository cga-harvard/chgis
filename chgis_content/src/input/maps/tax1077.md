</p><p class="monkey">
Commercial tax quotas for prefectural and county administrative seats and for towns in Liangzhe Circuit as of 1077. The tax data, given in strings of cash (guan), is based on the comprehensive national commercial tax quota list found in the *Song huiyao jigao*. Prefectural and county seats are based on CHGIS V. 2, time series data. The location of non-administrative towns is determined with reference to the *Zhejiang gujin diming cidian* (Zhejiang jiaoyu chuban she, 1991) and point information in the CHGIS V. 2, 1911 data layer and ArcChina. The map illustrates the divergence between the economic and administrative hierarchies
