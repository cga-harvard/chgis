The following thematic maps are based on county level statistics for Shanxi Province. Working with the locations of county administrative seats, approximate county areas were generated in GIS using the Thiessen Polygon method. The boundaries therefore are approximate, but when aggregated to the entire province are useful for showing the distribution of the households and grain quotas across space.
