                             CHINA GIS PROJECT

                  LAND-USE MAP OF CHINA SPATIAL DATA BASE

       DRAINAGE BASIN AND STREAM REACH CODING SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES


The following codes and proceedures have been used by the Australian Centre
of the Asian Spatial Information and Analysis Network (ACASIAN), Griffith
University, to identify and characterise the hydrology it has vectorised
from the 1:1,000,000 Land-use Map of China (the LUMC Spatial Data Bases),
produced by the Institute of Geography, CAS, and published by the Science
Press, Beijing.

'Streams' is an all-inclusive term that includes lakes and large reservoirs
that are connected to drainage systems, as well as large rivers and
estuaries depicted on the Land-use Map of China (LUMC) as having two
shorelines (e.g., as open water).  In those cases, each bank or shore is
coded separately unless the body of 'open' water has no outlet.  The other
exceptions are limited to the small reservoirs marked with tiny triangular
symbols on the LUMC, which are marked by the NCODE 4.


CODES USED FOR ARCS (LINES) AND NODES (POINTS)

LSOURCE - 'Line Source':  Almost all of the hydrological data in the China
     GIS Project Spatial Databases are derived from the 1:1m Land-use Map
     of China (LUMC).  Lines in the HYLP ('hydrology lines & polygons')
     coverages sourced from the LUMC have the relevant sheet number in
     LSOURCE, which also identifies alternate sources of hydrological
     information used for lines not based on the LUMC.  Original LUMC
     lines judged to be erroneous or that have been changed in some way
     are contained in the HYCHNG ('hydro change') coverages for each map
     sheet.

NCODE - 'Node Code':  Some nodes in HYLP have special codes:
     0 -  continuing node with no special significance for drainage
          topology, but needed for some reason such as a change in LCODE,
          etc., as described below.

     1 -  stop: arbitrary divide between drainage basins shown as
          connected on the LUMC.
     4 -  reservoir: location of small reservoir represented as a tiny
          triangular symbol on the LUMC.
     7 -  viaduct: where crossing streams are actually separate.

LCODE - 'Line Code':  Vectors in HYLP are coded as follows:
     09 -      connector: underground portions of streams not shown on the
               LUMC.
     10 - tiny streams/canals having the lightest lineweight on the LUMC.
     11 - small rivers/canals having the second lightest lineweight on
          the LUMC.
     12 - medium rivers/canals having the next to heaviest lineweight on
          the LUMC.
     13 - large rivers/canals having the heaviest lineweight on the LUMC.
     14 - rivers shown as flowing underground on the LUMC.
     15 - seasonal streams shown on the LUMC.
     17 - large canal, as identified on the LUMC.
     20 - open river, depicted with two shorelines on the LUMC.
     30 - estuary or bay, cut off from the ocean by a coastline connector
          (LTYPE 99).
     40 - lake, slough, or large reservoir.
     45 -      seasonal lakes.
     47 -      boundaries of marshes or reed marshes occurring in lakes.
     50 -      island in a lake or reservoir.
     60 - island in a river
     91 -      errors on the LUMC (contained in the HYCHNG coverages, only.
     96- connector: to close mouth of river with two shores.
     97 - connector: to close lake or slough connected to river with two
          shores.
     98 - connector: to close map sheet boundary, as necessary.
     99 -  connector: to close coastline across estuaries and deep bays.

BCODE     - 'Basin Code':  Drainage basins, including lake segments, are coded
          with a six digit system similar to the eight digit Hydrological Unit
          Codes (HUCs) employed in the United States, except that a fourth,
          lowest level (Catelog Unit) is not identified.  
     The first two BCODE digits (initial zeros added) are from the
     'Drainage system' map on page 4 of 'The Population Atlas of China'
     (English Edition, 1987, Cambridge U.P.) .
          01 to 18 - Pacific Ocean drainage basins.
          19 to 22 - Indian Ocean drainage basins.
          23 - Arctic Ocean drainage basin.
          24 to 35 - interior drainage basins
     The next two BCODE digits, representing subbasins, are based on the
     'tributary basins' on the same map, with some modifications and
     additions, such as demarcating subsections of major rivers (Heiling
     Jiang, Huang He, Yangzi Jiang, and the variously named parts of the
     'West River System'), designating additional subbasins (particularly
     on the North China Plain and in Manchuria), and distinguishing Hainan
     island (1602) as a separate subbasin from the coastal rivers of
     western Guangdong and Guangxi (1601).  Subbasin and subsection code
     numbers are arbitrarily assigned from north to south or clockwise
     along the coast and upstream in major river systems.
     The third BCODE digit (first subbasin digit) carries the following
     distinctions:
          0 - The subbasin or subsection empties directly into the ocean.
          1, 2, 3, or 4 - These are subsections of large rivers, which
          usually have complex distributaries where they enter the ocean,
          which have 00 for subbasin codes, e.g., 1500xx for the Pearl
          River delta complex.  The 'West River System' is coded as the
          main river in that system, while the North and East Rivers are
          coded as its tributaries, as indicated the source cited above.
          5 - These subbasins have tributary subbasins and empty into the
          sea.
          6 and 7 - These subbasins have tributary subbasins of their
          own, but are themselves tributary to a subsection of a major
          river, or to another such subbasin.
          8 - Used for the upper reaches of large rivers that originate
          in China but enter the sea in other countries (with the
          exception of the Heilongjiang/Amur complex, which uses the
          foregoing codes for sections along the boarder with Russia).
          9 - These subbasins drain internally and are not connected to
          the sea.
     The fourth BCODE digit (second subbasin digit) has the following
     distinctions:
          0 - The basin, draining directly into the sea, is not divided
          into subbasins or sections.  Also used as the fourth digit for
          sections of large rivers, including the terminal
          distributaries, or for those with subbasins coded with 5.
          1, 2, 3, and 4 - Discrete subbasins with only one major stream
          (or perhaps two at the most), ordered from downstream to
          upstream or, for composite coastal drainage basins, from north
          to south or clockwise along the coast.
          5, 6, 7, and 8 - Basins or subbasins along a large river or
          along the coast that consist of multiple small stream systems
          that reach the river or the sea separately, ordered from
          downstream to upstream or, for coastal drainage systems, from
          north to south or clockwise along the coast.
          9 - Major Canals or rivers with managed courses (that appear
          aberrant in terms of normal drainage patterns and cross
          subbasin boundaries or are major features within them).
     BCODE digits five and six, for sub-subbasins, are assigned in the
     same fashion as subbasin codes and designate the same general
     distinctions.  In general only streams that are named on the LUMC are
     distinguished as discrete sub-subbasins, except in the cases of sub-
     subbasins that consist of many small streams which empty directly
     into the sea or into a river.  
     The fifth BCODE digit (first sub-subbasin digit) carries the
     following distictions:
          1, 2, 3 and 4 - Used for subsections of the main stream in a
          sub-basin.
          5 - Used for a tributary or sub-subbasin that directly enters a
          subbasin mainstream or the sea and that has significant
          tributaries of its own.
          6 and 7 - Used for sub-subbasins tributary to other sub-
          subbasins, but which have significant tributaries of their own.
     The sixth BCODE digit (second sub-subbasin digit) has the following
     distinctions:
          1, 2, 3, and 4 - Discrete sub-subbasins with only one major
          stream (or perhaps two at the most), ordered from downstream to
          upstream or, for composite coastal drainage basins, from north
          to south or clockwise along the coast.
          5, 6, 7, and 8 - sub-subbasins along a large river or along the
          coast that consist of multiple small stream systems that reach
          the river or the sea separately, ordered from downstream to
          upstream or, for coastal drainage systems, from north to south
          or clockwise along the coast. 
     Exceptions to the use of the above codes for sixth BCODE digits occur
     with respect to canals and managed rivers (that appear aberrant in
     terms of normal drainage patterns):  XXX901, ..., etc. and  XXX905,
     ...., etc are important (named on the LUMC) and individually coded
     canals or rivers with managed courses which cross subbasin boundaries
     or are major features within them;  XXX909 is reserved for sections
     of the Grand Canal (Da YingHe).
     Appendix 1 contains a listing of the major river(s) in each coded
     basin and subbasin.

BSYMBOL - 'Basin Symbol':  All lines in the same Basin are given an
     arbitrary colour code for display purposes.

SBSYMBOL - 'Subbasin Symbol': All lines in the same Basin are given an
     arbitrary colour code for display purposes.

SSBSYMBOL - 'Sub-subbasin Symbol': Lines in the same Sub-subbasin may be
     given an arbitrary colour code for display purposes.


STEPS IN DRAINAGE BASIN CODING

1.  On each LUMC map sheet, or portions thereof, hydrological outlets are
operator identified.  They can include the sheet edges, as well as
coastlines, underground or desert 'sinks', and the places where subbasins
or even sub-subbasins drain into larger rivers.  These outlet vectors are
'flipped' to point downstream, as necessary, and can be 'frozen' in that
direction.  NCODEs (stop nodes in particular) and RCODEs may also be
attached to outlets at this stage if desired, along with BCODEs, as
appropriate.

     FROZEN - 'Frozen':  Specifies whether the vector can be subsequently
     flipped to the opposite direction.  This item will be included with
     CGISP HYLP coverages when they are distributed.
     0 -  not frozen, can be flipped.
     1 -  frozen, cannot be flipped

2.  The FLIP program is then run, which uses Arcedit commands and thererore
avoids moving between Arcedit and Arcplot.  It checks the direction of all
vectors connected to each outlet, and if necessary changes them to go
toward it, unless a vector is 'frozen'.  FLIP will continue past frozen
vectors, if they point in the right direction, to find more connections,
flipping them as necessary.  FLIP may be run in a batch mode for all
outlets on a sheet or in a basin/subbasin/sub-subbasin, or interactively
from one outlet at a time.  When it has processed a vector, FLIP marks it
as 'done'.  Vectors which do not get 'done' are not connected to an outlet
for some reason, which must be identified and corrected as necessary. 
Perhaps some outlets are not identified, or some tributaries do not
actually connect properly, etc.

     DONE - 'Processed':  Specifies whether or not the FLIP program has
     processed a vector.  This item will not normally be supplied with
     CGISP HYLP coverages.
     0 -  not yet processed.
     1 -  processed and flipped towards outlet as necessary.

3.  The NODECHK ('node check') program cannot be run until FLIP has been
run at least once.  It identifies all nodes that have more than one
outgoing vector (e.g., the same node is the origin of more than one
vector).  This identifies 'cycles', or sets of vectors that close or would
form polygons if they were processed.  Some of these are legitimate, as
when there is a terminal body of open water that has no outlet or where
there are series of interconnecting canals, in which cases the direction of
the vectors defining the shoreline or 'flow' are irrelevant.

However, NODECHK allows other anomalies to be identified and corrected. 
Some examples are non-terminal lake/reservoir shores which cycle, braided
streams which cycle, two (or more) outlets from the same basin, and
erroneous interconnections between basins.  Operators can then deal with
these problems as necessary by appropriately flipping and freezing lake
shores and distributaries, marking viaduct nodes (which require additional
outlets to be defined), identifying interconnecting canals and isolating
those that link basins with stop nodes as needed, and placing other
required stop nodes, etc.  Also, errors in the LUMC or in vectorizing from
it, such as spurious interconnections between basins, can also be
identified and corrected from it or other sources.  At this step,
identified distributaries are usually given the TDCCODEs/RCODEs 'd' and/or
't' when they are frozen in the right direction, while terminal lake shores
are normally given the RCODE 'T' and irrelevant canals the RCODE/TDCCODE
'c' as they are identified.  Small menu programs accomplish these tasks.

Steps 2 and 3 can be reiterated, interactively or in batch mode, as
necessary by first setting DONE to 0 and then re-running FLIP and/or
NODECHK until an operator is satisfied that no anomalies remain.

4.  The BASIN program is then run.  It is an iterative program that uses
the Arcedit command 'select connect' until there are no more vectors
connected to an outlet that can be found.  It will find other outlets, such
as distributaries in a delta, but it does not change the direction of
vectors and does not continue past a stop node (NCODE 1).  BASIN
automatically attaches BCODES, which are operator assigned to outlets at
this or previous steps, to each vector (including LCODES 20 and 40-60) in a
basin, subbasin or sub-subbasin, as appropriate, in the BCODE item.

5.  Once a complete basin or subbasin has been given the appropriate BCODE
by running the BASIN program on the HYLP coverage for each LUMC sheet that
contains any part of it, the basin can be placed on a separate HYLP
coverage of its own, named after its BCODE.  Steps 2 (FLIP) and 3 (NODECHK)
are then run again as a final check on the integrity of the data for the
whole basin, and any remaining problems are rectified.

6.  There are two current ways of counting stream order.  The most recently
developed and hydrologically meaningful is the Shreve system, which adds
together all upstream reaches, from which the number of sources in a basin
can be readily determined.  The SHSORDER program calculates the Shreve
stream order value for each reach, and enters it in the SHSORDER item.  The
STSORDER program puts values into the STSORDER item based on the older
Strahler system that numbers stream order by increasing the downstream
value only when the values of both upstream components are the same (two 1s
make a 2, but two 2s make a 3 and two 3s yield a 4, with all non matching
upstream values being ignored apart from continuing with the largest). 
Both of these programs treat the two shores of bodies of open water (LCODEs
20, 40 and 45) as if they were collapsed into one line, effective after the
node where they rejoin or are terminated with a connector (LCODE 96 or 99).

     SHSORDER - the Shreve stream order value for each reach.

     STSORDER - the Strahler stream order value for each reach.

7.  If the whole basin has not had LCODEs 9 through 19 set properly, it
could be done at this time with reference to the LUMC, if the REACODE
program will not be used subsequently.  Names from the LUMC could also be
attached to the main streams defining sub-subbasins with NAME and ID could
be used to identify the principal stream from begining to end.  BASIN could
also be run from their outlets to change their BCODEs to those indicating
sub-subbasins, as appropriate.  However, these things may be accomplished
most economically in conjunction with the REACODE program.

The REACODE ('Reach Code') program codes each reach of a main stream, in
items RNUMBER and RCODE, according to its position in the typology of the
whole stream system from its source to where and how it ends, after
flipping for stream flow direction, as necessary.  (REACODE recognises
'frozen' vectors and will not change their direction.)  REACODE also
attaches information to the ending reach of each tributary, distributary,
or connecting canal, recording the details of its connection to the main
stream in the item TDCCODE ('Tributary/Distributary/Canal Code').  

REACODE uses the Arcedit 'select path' command to define the mainstream
between between an operator selected source (or other begining vector) and
an outlet (or other end point).  Where it is known from source maps that
the mainstream does not follow the shortest path between a begining and an
end, for instance in braided stream systems or canal networks, the operator
can set the IMP (impedence) item to 99 on selected vectors in order to
force 'trace' to follow the desired route.

If REACODE is run on all of the streams in a basin, the typology of the
entire basin will be represented in the RNUMBER, RCODE, and TDCCODE items,
conjointly.  Normally, REACODE will have been run only on the main (named)
streams in each sub-subbasin in the China GIS Project HYPL coverages. 
However, anyone running REACODE on uncoded CGISP HYPL coverages should
obtain the same results if no changes have been made to the original HYLP
data in the basin.  The most salient aspects of the typology of a basin are
available when REACODE has been run on the mainstream, only, provided
SHSORDER has also been run on the basin as a whole.

     IMP - 'Impedence': gives artificial lengths to selected vectors in
     order to force the 'trace' command to follow the desired path.  IMP
     values will normally be supplied with CGISP HYPL coverages.
     1  - no special impedence.
     99 - ninty-nine times normal impedence.

     RNUMBER - 'Reach Number': The ordinal number of each reach is
     recorded, beginning with the source of a stream and increasing
     sequentially downstream to its end.  RNUMBERs for reaches just
     downstream from open water (such as lakes, reservoirs, and sections
     with two banks) are calculated according to the following formula:
     RNUMBER = 1 + #(Lj) + #(Rj) - #(p) [codes as below].  A final value
     calculated with a similar formula (RNUMBER = 1 + #(Le) + #(Re) - #(p)
     will be attached to any connecting vectors (LCODEs 96, 97, or 99)
     that mark the ending of a stream.

     RCODE - 'Reach Code': After vectors are oriented to the downstream
     direction (by REACODE itself or by previous runs of the FLIP
     program), stream reaches are coded by the REACODE program according
     to what occurs at the 'tonode' of their vectors.  Codes for reach
     'types' as input by operators previously or subsequently are also
     included.  The following codes are used in combination, in no
     particular order, in the RCODE item.

     Continuing nodes, with only one outgoing vector:
     a  - 'aboveground': when a stream reappears on the surface joined by
          segments with LCODE 9 or 14 to upstream above-ground reaches.
     k  -      'small reservoirs (shuiku)': as identified with NCODE = 4.
     n  -      'node': any other kind of continuing node without a third
               connecting vector, such as one needed for a change in LCODE,
               LSYMBOL, SNAME, or SNAV (Default value, when NCODE = 0.
     s  - 'stop node': used to isolate a distributary linking to another
          basin (NCODE = 1)
     u  - 'underground': when a stream goes into a sink joined by an
          LCODE 14 or 94 segment to downstream above-ground reaches.
     v  -      'viaduct': a connection of four vectors in HYPL that is not a
               true intersection as one stream bridges another (NCODE = 7).

     Continuing nodes, with more than two connecting vectors:
     l  - 'left':  upstream reach of the main stream to the left of a
          tributary/ distributary.
     r  - 'right':  upstream reach of the main stream is to the right of
          a tributary/ distributary.
     ll - 'left, left':  upstream reach of the main stream is to the left
          of two tributaries/distributaries (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     rr - 'right, right':  upstream reach of the main stream is to the
          right of two tributaries/distributaries (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     rl, or lr - 'right, left' or 'left, right':  upstream reach of main
          stream is to both left and right of tributaries/distributaries
          on either side (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     L -  'Left bank': Left side of a body of open water, such as a
          lake/reservoir or river/estuary with two shores depicted on the
          LUMC, possibly with a left tributary/distributary at the tonode
          (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     R  - 'Right bank':  Right side of a body of open water, such as a
          lake/reservoir or river/estuary with two shores depicted on the
          LUMC, possibly with a right tributary/distributary at the
          tonode (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     LL  -     'Left bank':  left side of a body of open water, such as a
          lake/reservoir or river/estuary with two shores depicted on the
          LUMC, with two left tributaries/distributaries at the same
          tonode (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     RR  -     'Right bank': right side of a body of open water, such as a
          lake/reservoir or river/estuary with two shores depicted on the
          LUMC, with two right tributaries/distributaries at the same
          tonode (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     p  - 'parts':  node at which a single line representing a stream
          becomes two lines signifying open water with two banks or
          shores.
     j  - 'joins':  node at which two lines signifying open water with
          two banks or shores become a single downstream line.
     d -  'distributary': the vector is a distributary, with its vector
          pointing away from the outlet (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     c -  'canal': the vector is a canal so its direction is irrelevant
          (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).

     Ending nodes:
     e  - 'enters, empties, ends':  a tributary joins a main stream.
     o  - 'ocean':  a stream reaches the sea.
     s  - 'stop':  a reach that connects with a stop node (NCODE = 1)
          that separates basins (OPERATOR ASSIGNED.
     t  - 'terminates':  the end reach of a stream or distributary that
          does not connect with another stream, the sea, or a terminal
          body of inland water ('terminal' nodes are usually irrigation
          distributaries or desert sinks, and are normally operator
          identified and frozen at some early stage in Basin Coding
          proceedures).
     T  - 'Terminal': vector that forms part or all of the shore of a
          body of open water that has no outlet.  The direction of such
          vectors has no significance (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).

     TDCCODE - 'Tributary/Distributary/Canal Codes':  The adjacent reaches
     of connecting streams are coded by the REACODE program when it is run
     over a main stream.  The following are used in combination, in any
     order, in the TDCCODE item:
     i -  'incoming': the connected vector is a tributary, with its
          vector pointing toward the main stream (default).
     d -  'distributary': the connected vector is a distributary, with
          its vector pointing away from the main stream.
     c -  'canal': the connected vector is a canal, so the direction of
          the vector is irrelevant (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     l -  'left': the vector connects with the main stream from/to the
          left.
     r -  'right': the vector connects with the main stream from/to the
          right.  
     s -  'smallest': In case of multiple left or right tributaries/
          distributaries at the same node, this has the smallest angle
          with the downstream vector (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     b -  'biggest': In case of multiple left or right tributaries/
          distributaries at the same node, this has the biggest angle
          with the downstream vector (OPERATOR ASSIGNED).
     # -  'number': the same RNUMBER as the reach of the main stream with
          the 'tonode' where the tributary/distributary/canal connects.

SUBSIDIARY PROGRAMS activated by menu commands or from prompts in REACODE:

     MSID - 'Main stream identification':  the ID menu command will attach
     the appropriate Basin, Subbasin, or Sub-Subbasin ID to the MSID item
     for each reach (including open water reaches with LCODE 20 or 40/45) 
     of the principal stream in a basin, subbasin, or sub-subbasin when
     they have been identified with the Arcedit 'selpath' command or in
     conjunction with the REACODE program.

     LCODE - 'Line code': Possible values are listed above under LCODE.  
     An LCODE menu command will enter LCODE values for a selection set
     when they have been identified with the Arcedit 'trace' command or in
     conjunction with the REACODE program.  LCODE appends new LCODEs to
     any existing lists, an.

     SNAME - 'Stream name':  The name of a stream or canal taken from the
     LUMC, in pinyin.  Character names will be in an associated ORACLE
     database.  An SNAME menu command will enter SNAME values for each
     appropriate reach when they have been identified with the Arcedit
     'trace' command or in conjunction with the REACODE program.

     LNAME - 'Lake/Reservoir name':  The name of a lake or reservoir taken
     from the LUMC in pinyin.  Character names will be in an associated
     ORACLE database.  An LNAME menu command will attach the LNAME value
     to a point within the banks of the body of water that will be used to
     identify the polygon.  REACODE will also prompt for the entry of the
     LNAME when the second, longer shore is operator identified.

     NAVS - 'Navigable stream':  Reaches of streams, canals, and lakes
     identified on the official 1:2.5m Transport Map of China as being
     navigable.  A NAV menu command will enter NAVS values for each
     appropriate reach when they have been identified with the Arcedit
     'trace' command or in conjunction with the REACODE program.

     LSYMBOL - 'Line symbol':  Default symbols for displaying lines in
     HYPL coverages when using Arcedit can be set for each appropriate
     reach, etc., in the LSYMBOL item using the SYMBOL menu command,
     either with the Arcedit 'trace' command or in conjunction wth the
     REACODE program.


NEW CODES FOR POLYGONS IN THE CGISP HYLP COVERAGES

     PTYPE - 'Polygon code':  Polygons in the HYLP coverages are coded as
     follows:

     0 - No significance:  Not recognised as a hydrological feature.
          Examples are land enclosed by braided streams or canals
          represented on the LUMC by single lines, which are only
          technically islands.

     1 - Lake, Slough, Reservoir, or 'Fresh Water Breeding Plot': As  
     indicated with two shores on the LUMC.

     2 - Open River:  Polygons defined by two banks of a river, often
          closed downstream by a connector (LTYPE 96 or 99).

     3 - Estuary or Bay: Polygon cut off from the ocean by a connector
          (LTYPE 99).

     4 - Marsh Land:  Polygon that is usually contained within a Code 1
          polygon 

     5 - Island in a Lake or Reservoir.

     6 - Island in a River depicted with two shores on the LUMC


CHANGES TO ORIGINAL CODES FOR HYLP COVERAGES

Preliminary steps to be taken when an HYLP coverage for a LUMC map sheet is
first processed, or when a basin is made into a separate coverage, or when
the relevant programs are first run on coverages.


CHANGE - Creates new items and copies old values with some changes,
     automatically, as follows:
     1.  IMP:  Retain, with values if present, otherwise create.
     2.  LSOURCE:  Copy values from LINESRC.
     3.  LCODE:  Copy values from LINETYPE, with following changes:
          old 12 (underground river) becomes 14 if shown on LUMC;
          old 21 (slough) becomes 40;
          old 42 (marsh) becomes 47.
     4.  NCODE:  Copy values from ?????, if any.
     5.  PCODE:  Copy values from POLYTYPE, with following changes:
          old 10 (Lake/Reservoir) becomes 1;
          old 20 (Braided channel) becomes 2 (Open River);
          old 50 (Island - Lake) becomes 5;
          old 55 (Marsh Land) becomes 4
          old 60 (Island - Braided Channel) becomes 6 (Island in an open   
          river)

FLIP - Creates the following:
     6.  FROZEN:  Retain, with values, if present, otherwise create.
     7.  DONE:  Retain, with values, if present, otherwise create.

BASIN - Creates the following:
     8.  BCODE:  Replaces LINEBASIN, which should have no present values.
     9.  SHSORDER:  Create.
     10.  STSORDER:  Create.

REACODE - Creates the following:
     11.  LNAME:  Create
     12.  LSYMBOL:  Create.
     13.  MSID:  Create.
     14.  NAV:  Create.
     15.  SNAME:  Create.
     16.  RCODE:  Create.
     17.  RNUMBER:  Create.
     18.  TDCCODE:  Create.

REMOVE - Program run when basin coverages are completely processed.
     1. DONE:  Not supplied with CGISP HYLP Coverages.
     2.  All original items superceded by the new items, above, including:
     LINETYPE; LINESRC; LINEID; LINEBASIN; STREAMORDER, AND POLYTYPE. 
     These items will remain on the separate HYLP coverages for the
     individual LUMC sheets.
     3.  All other original items not supplied with CGISP HYLP Coverages, 
     including: LINESTAT and POLYSTAT.  These items will remain on the
     separate HYLP coverages for the individual LUMC sheets.
