<P>Coverage of arcs and nodes representing major transportation routes and destinations. Arcs include national, provincial, and local highways; railroads; and navigable rivers.

<P>Source arcs were digitized by ACASIAN. At UCD, arcs in each source series (roads-pr, rails-pr, and hylp) were selected for inclusion in the transportation network, edited into a nationwide coverage, and coded. Nodes were added where arcs most closely approached each of 12,400+ points representing populated central places. Each arc was coded as to its length in an appropriate UTM projection, in which scale errors are minimized; arcs were also assigned their surface distance as calculated over a 1km-resolution digital elevation model.</TD>

<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Source arcs (roads, railroads, and rivers) were digitized by ACASIAN. Some edgematching and other minor corrections were applied at UCD.</P>
<P>At UCD, arcs in each source series (roads-pr, rails-pr, and hylp) were selected for inclusion in the transportation network. Each series was edited separately to edgematch continuous arcs across provincial or tile boundaries, and then appended into nationwide coverages (<B>roadnet</B>, <B>railnet</B>, and <B>navnet</B>).  From the Hylp series, only those arcs coded at UCD as navigable, per <I>Atlas of China</I>, were extracted and retained. </P>
<P>To accommodate transportation across major lakes and in near-coastal waters, two additional transportation components was developed.  For lakes, all lakes and wide rivers from the hylp coverage which had at least one shoreline arc coded as navigable were extracted into a new coverage (<B>navpoly</B>).  An arbitrary, regularly defined 10x10 kilometer grid was then generated and clipped by navpoly to produce a coverage named <B>navmesh</B>.  Similarly for near-coastal waters, a twenty-kilometer buffer along China's coastline (as defined in the PONET county boundaries coverage) was created.  An arbitrary, regularly defined 20x20 kilometer grid was then generated an clipped by this buffer to produce a coverage named <B>coastwise</B>.</P>
<P>The arc attribute tables for all of the components (<B>roadnet</B>, <B>railnet</B>, <B>navnet</B>, <B>navmesh</B>, and <B>coastwise</B>) were standardized, retaining only those items defined below.  Then these components were appended to create the arc coverage <B>transnet</B>, which was further modified as described here.</P>
<P>Using <U>NearSplit.aml</U>, nodes were added where arcs most closely approached each of 12,000+ points representing populated central places (as shown in the CP<I>xx</I> series). The NAT file entry for each of these nodes was coded with the T1 identifier for its central place; other nodes are coded zero. Central places georeferenced within 350 meters of another central place may be omitted from the NAT.</P>
<P>Using <U>SetEQlength.aml</U>, arcs were coded with their planimetric length in an equidistant projection and with their length over the topographic surface of the earth. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system was selected to provide the equidistant projection because it produces a scale error of not more than 0.1% within each UTM zone, and because it is more convenient to apply the well-known UTM zone system than to define other equidistant projection systems for every possible local study area in China. Arcs were first split at the boundaries of UTM zones (every sixth degree of longitude). Arcs within each UTM zone were then copied to a separate coverage and projected into the UTM projection for their zone. The length of each projected arc, as computed by the Arc/Info GIS, was then copied to the EQLENGTH item in the original AAT. In a separate operation, each arc's surface length, SLENGTH, was calculated by Arc/Info using CHDEM (a 1km-resolution digital elevation model); the surface length was then adjusted to offset the projection error by multiplying it by the ratio of EQLENGTH to LENGTH, producing SEQLENGTH.</P>
<P>The <U>RCSdistance.aml</U> script is used to generate an Arc/Info Route system and compute network costs (distances multiplied by relative cost factors estimated for various modes of transportation) between nodes based on LENGTH, EQLENGTH, and SEQLENGTH.</TD>
